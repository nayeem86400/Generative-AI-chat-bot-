# Generative-AI-chat-bot-

Overview:
This project is a smart chatbot built using Chainlit and fine-tuned on the Llama2 model with the Guanaco dataset from Hugging Face. The bot can not only engage in natural conversations but also answer questions based on the content of uploaded PDFs using a FAISS vector database.

Features:
1. Advanced Chatbot: Built on Chainlit and fine-tuned with the Llama2 model over the Guanaco dataset, ensuring high-quality and contextually relevant responses.
2. PDF Querying: Upload PDFs to the chatbot, which then uses a FAISS vector database to store and retrieve information, allowing the bot to answer questions based on the PDF content.
3. Efficient Data Handling: Utilizes FAISS for fast and accurate similarity search within the vector database, ensuring quick and precise responses.
4. Seamless Integration: Easy to integrate into existing applications or services, providing a powerful conversational interface and document understanding capabilities.
